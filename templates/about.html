        Hello dear visitor!
        I am a passionate individual with a diverse set of interests, including sports, video games, traveling, and new technologies.
        From my early years, I immersed myself in the world of video games, evolving into a professional Counter-Strike 1.6 player and fueling my enthusiasm for the gaming industry.
        My journey took an exciting turn at the age of 19 when I joined Ubisoft as a Game Tester while concurrently pursuing my four-year University bachelor's degree.
        Over the next decade, I grew within Ubisoft Bucharest, culminating in my role as a Networking QA Lead.

        A pivotal move led me to Kyiv, where I played a crucial role in establishing specialized testing teams.
        After four fulfilling years in Kyiv, I embraced a new chapter in Sofia, joining SEGA as a QA Manager, where I've spent the last three years contributing to the success of various projects.
        Throughout my career, I've been involved in over 30 projects, including renowned titles like the Assassin's Creed franchise, Watch Dogs, Far Cry, and Just Dance, as well as mobile games, VR experiences, mobile apps, and web testing.

        My expertise spans PMP Waterfall and Agile Project Management methodologies, Leadership, Coaching, Video games and Software testing, and proficiency in tools such as JIRA, Confluence, and Power-BI.
        Continuously adapting, I've recently delved into Python and its various libraries, further expanding my skill set.
